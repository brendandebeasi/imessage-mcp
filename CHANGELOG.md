# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `send_message` now accepts `attachments_b64`: inline base64 attachments for callers without Mac filesystem access (e.g. Sane on prod). Decoded to a secure per-call temp dir, attached by path, and cleaned up after send.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **HTTP transport**: `--transport http` starts a Streamable HTTP server (MCP 2025-03-26 standard) on `/mcp` with session management
- **Legacy SSE transport**: `--transport sse` for older MCP clients that don't support Streamable HTTP
- **CLI flags**: `--transport` (`-t`), `--port` (`-p`), `--host` (`-H`) for flexible server configuration
- **Docker support**: multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` for running as an HTTP server in containers
- **Smithery registry**: `smithery.yaml` for one-click install via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai)
- **iCloud Sync guide**: comprehensive documentation for syncing message history across Apple devices
- HTTP transport entry in `server.json` for MCP Registry discovery

### Changed
- README restructured: privacy moved up, tools collapsed, liberal use of `<details>` for a scannable layout
- Troubleshooting entries updated with iCloud sync cross-references

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **`check_new_messages` tool**: track new messages since your last check with baseline + delta pattern
- **Real-time sync**: `IMESSAGE_SYNC=watch` uses macOS FSEvents for near-instant new message notifications
- **Poll sync**: `IMESSAGE_SYNC=poll:N` for polling every N seconds as an alternative to FSEvents
- **Forward pagination**: cursor-based pagination now supports both backward and forward navigation
- 26th tool (check_new_messages) bringing the total to 26

### Changed
- **100% TypeScript source**: all remaining JavaScript converted to TypeScript
- `get_conversation` supports forward pagination via `after` cursor

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Claude Code plugin**: 5 slash commands, 2 agents (`deep-dive`, `storyteller`), 3 enhanced skills, post-install hook
- **Contact name search**: search by name ("Mom") instead of phone number in `search_messages` and `get_conversation`
- Demo GIFs for light and dark mode
- Ready-to-paste JSON config in `doctor` output

### Fixed
- **Safe Mode gaps**: `get_message_effects`, `get_reactions`, `list_attachments`, and `get_edited_messages` now redact message bodies when `IMESSAGE_SAFE_MODE=1`

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Safe Mode** (`IMESSAGE_SAFE_MODE=1`): redacts all message bodies, returns only metadata
- **MCP Registry listing** via `server.json`
- Collapsible setup sections for 8 MCP clients in README

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Smart spam filtering**: only includes contacts you've replied to; opt out with `include_all: true`
- **Two-pass search**: fast SQL LIKE + `attributedBody` extraction for complete results on macOS 14+
- **Contact name resolution** from macOS AddressBook with fuzzy matching
- `resolve_contact` tool for matching names, phones, and emails
- `attributedBody` text extraction for macOS Sonoma+ messages with NULL `text` column

### Fixed
- Search now includes sent messages in spam filter results

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **25 MCP tools** across 9 categories: messages, contacts, analytics, memories, patterns, wrapped, groups, attachments, reactions/receipts/threads/edits/effects, and help
- **Read-only** SQLite access with `readonly: true` and `query_only = ON`
- **Parameterized queries** for security — no SQL string interpolation
- `readOnlyHint: true` annotations for MCP client auto-approval
- **CLI commands**: `doctor` (setup diagnostics) and `dump` (JSON export)
- macOS `attributedBody` binary parser for Sonoma+ message text extraction
- AddressBook resolver with phone digit normalization and email lookup
